# Matrix Operations & Linear System Solver in GNU Octave


---

## ðŸ“„ Description

This project is a comprehensive tool for analyzing and processing two-dimensional matrices, implemented in GNU Octave. It offers flexible functionalities that allow:

- Element-wise computation of mathematical functions (cos, sin) on matrices.
- Creation of customized transformations based on element characteristics.
- Selective application of operations on matrix subregions.
- Calculation of complex mathematical functions on each element.
- Identification of maximum and minimum values along with their exact positions.
- Interactive solving of linear systems of equations.
